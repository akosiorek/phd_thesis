\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:discussion}

With MOHART, we introduce an end-to-end multi-object tracker that is capable of capturing complex interactions and leveraging these for precise predictions as experiments both on toy and real world data show. However, the experiments also show that the benefit of relational reasoning strongly depends on the nature of the data. The toy experiments showed that in an entirely deterministic world relational reasoning was much less important than in a stochastic environment. Amongst the real-world dataset, the highest performance gains from relational reasoning were achieved on the MOTChallenge dataset, which features crowded scenes, ego-motion and occlusions.
