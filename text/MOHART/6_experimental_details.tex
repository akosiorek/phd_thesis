\section{Experimental Details}
\label{sec:mohart_experimental_details}
The MOTChallenge and the UA-DETRAC dataset discussed in this section are intended to be used as a benchmark suite for multi-object-tracking in a tracking-by-detection paradigm. Therefore, ground truth bounding boxes are only available for the training datasets. The user is encouraged to upload their model which performs tracking in a data association paradigm leveraging the provided bounding box proposals from an external object detector. As we are interested in a different analysis (IoU given inital bounding boxes), we divide the training data further into training and test sequences. To make up for the smaller training data, we extend the MOTChallenge 2017 dataset with three sequences from the 2015 dataset (ETH-Sunnyday, PETS09-S2L1, ETH-Bahnhof). We use the first 70\% of the frames of each of the ten sequences for training and the rest for testing. Sequences with high frame rates (30Hz) are sub-sampled with a stride of two. For the UA-DETRAC dataset, we split the 60 available sequences into 44 training sequences and 16 test sequences. For the considerably larger Stanford Drone dataset we took three videos of the scene \textit{deathCircle} for training and the remaining two videos from the same scene for testing. The videos of the drone dataset were also sub-sampled with a stride of two to increase scene dynamics.
