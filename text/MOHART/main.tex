\begin{abstract}
    % Tracking-by-detection is a well-established multi-object tracking paradigm, which however cannot handle cases of tracking objects from unseen categories often required in rich real-world environments.
    % In this work, we introduce MOHART, a class-agnostic end-to-end multi-object tracking algorithm, which estimates objects' states and considers relations between objects, while also allowing for future trajectory prediction, which is essential for planning purposes.
    % We use three real-world tracking datasets to show that adding relational reasoning capabilities increases the tracking and trajectory prediction performance, particularly in the presence of ego-motion, occlusions, crowded scenes, and faulty sensor inputs. To the best of our knowledge, MOHART is the first fully end-to-end multi-object tracking from vision approach applied to real-world data reported in the literature. 
    
	Relational reasoning---the ability to model interactions and relations between objects---is valuable for robust multi-object tracking and pivotal for trajectory prediction. In this paper, we propose MOHART, a class-agnostic, end-to-end multi-object tracking and trajectory prediction algorithm, which explicitly accounts for permutation invariance in its relational reasoning. We explore a number of permutation invariant architectures and show that multi-headed self-attention outperforms the provided baselines and better accounts for complex physical interactions in a challenging toy experiment. We show on three real-world tracking datasets that adding relational reasoning capabilities in this way increases the tracking and trajectory prediction performance, particularly in the presence of ego-motion, occlusions, crowded scenes, and faulty sensor inputs. To the best of our knowledge, MOHART is the first fully end-to-end multi-object tracking from vision approach applied to real-world data reported in the literature.

	%Relational reasoning is the ability to model interactions between objects and is critical for a number of cognitive functions and machine learning applications. In this paper, we explore relational reasoning in the context of multi-object tracking and the role of \emph{permutation invariance}. Specifically, we find that permutation-invariant models outperform non-permutation-invariant alternatives. We also find that architectures using a single permutation invariant operation like DeepSets, despite, in theory, being universal function approximators, are nonetheless outperformed by a more complex architecture based on multi-headed attention. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first fully end-to-end multi-object tracking algorithm. We show on three real-world tracking datasets that adding relational reasoning capabilities in our proposed way increases the tracking and trajectory prediction performance, particularly in the presence of ego-motion, occlusions, crowded scenes, and faulty sensor inputs.

%previous bounding-box. This simplifies the approach, but does not allow the model to learn where to look---\ie no gradient is backpropagated through crop coordinates.
%To the best of our knowledge, there are no successful implementations of any such end-to-end approaches for multi-object tracking beyond \textsc{sqair} \citep{Kosiorek2018sqair}, which works only on datasets with static backgrounds. On real-world data, the only end-to-end approaches correspond to applying multiple single-object trackers in parallel---a method which does not leverage the potential of scene context or inter-object interactions.
