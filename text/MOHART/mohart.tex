\begin{abstract}
	The majority of contemporary object-tracking approaches used in autonomous vehicles do not model interactions between objects. This contrasts with the fact that objects' paths are not independent: a cyclist might abruptly deviate from a previously planned trajectory in order to avoid colliding with a car.
	Building upon \textsc{hart}, a neural, class-agnostic single-object tracker, we introduce a multi-object tracking method (\textsc{mohart}) capable of \emph{relational reasoning}. Importantly, the entire system, including the understanding of interactions and relations between objects, is class-agnostic and learned simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion.
	We find that the addition of relational-reasoning capabilities to \textsc{hart} leads to consistent performance gains in tracking as well as future trajectory prediction on several real-world datasets (MOTChallenge, UA-DETRAC, and Stanford Drone dataset), particularly in the presence of ego-motion, occlusions, crowded scenes, and faulty sensor inputs.
	Finally, based on controlled simulations, we propose that a comparison of \textsc{mohart} and \textsc{hart} may be used as a novel way to measure the degree to which the objects in a video depend upon each other as they move together through time.
