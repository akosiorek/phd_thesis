\section{Harder multi-\textsc{mnist} Experiment}
\label{app:mnist_inout}
We created a version of the multi-\textsc{mnist} dataset, where objects can appear or disappear at an arbitrary point in time.
It differs from the dataset described in \Cref{sec:expr_mnist}, where all digits are present throughout the sequence.
All other dataset parameters are the same as in \Cref{sec:expr_mnist}.
\Cref{fig:mnist_rec_in_and_out} shows an example sequence and \textsc{mlp}-\gls{SQAIR} reconstructions with marked glimpse locations.
The model has no trouble detecting new digits in the middle of the sequence and rediscovering a digit that was previously present.
