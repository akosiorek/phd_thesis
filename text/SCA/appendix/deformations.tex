\section{Modelling Deformable Objects}
\label{app:deformations}

Each object capsule votes for part capsules by contributing Gaussian votes to mixture models, where the centers of these Gaussians are a product of an object-viewer \gls{OV} matrix and an object-part \gls{OP} matrix, cf.\ \Cref{eq:op,eq:ov,eq:vkn,eq:component}.
Importantly, the  $\textsc{op}_{k,n}$ matrices  are a sum of a static component $\textsc{op}_{k,n}^\mathrm{static}$, which represents the mean shape of an object, and a dynamic component $\textsc{op}_{k,n}^\mathrm{dynamic} = \MLP(\bc_k)$, which is a function of data, and can model deformations in objects' shape.
If an object capsule is to specialise to a specific object class, it should learn its mean shape.
Therefore we discourage large deformations, which also prevents an object capsule from modelling several objects at once.
Concretely, we add the weighted Frobenius norm of the deformation matrix $\alpha||\textsc{op}_{k,n}^\mathrm{dynamic}||_F^2$ to the loss, where $\alpha$ is a weight set to a high value, typically $\alpha=10$ in our experiments.
