\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
    
    Inspired by the cascaded attention mechanisms found in the human visual cortex, this work presented a neural attentive recurrent tracking architecture suited for the task of object tracking. Beyond the biological inspiration, the proposed approach has a desirable computational cost and increased interpretability due to location maps, which select features essential for tracking. Furthermore, by introducing a set of auxiliary losses we are able to scale to challenging real world data, outperforming predecessor attempts and approaching state-of-the-art performance. Future research will look into extending the proposed approach to multi-object tracking, as unlike many single object tracking, the recurrent nature of the proposed tracker offers the ability to attend each object in turn.
