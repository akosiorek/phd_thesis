Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols.

The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator of the inference model gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques.

Variational training of this type involves maximizing a lower bound on the log-likelihood, using samples from the variational posterior to compute the required gradients. Recently, Burda et al. (2016) have derived a tighter lower bound using a multi-sample importance sampling estimate of the likelihood and showed that optimizing it yields models that use more of their capacity and achieve higher likelihoods. This development showed the importance of such multi-sample objectives and explained the success of several related approaches. We extend the multi-sample approach to discrete latent variables and analyze the difficulty encountered when estimating the gradients involved. We then develop the first unbiased gradient estimator designed for importance-sampled objectives and evaluate it at training generative and structured output prediction models. The resulting estimator, which is based on low-variance per-sample learning signals, is both simpler and more effective than the NVIL estimator proposed for the single-sample variational objective, and is competitive with the currently used biased estimators.},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1602.06725},\\nauthor = {Mnih, Andriy and Rezende, Danilo J.},\\nbooktitle = {ICML},\\neprint = {1602.06725},\\nissn = {1938-7228},\\nmonth = feb,\\ntitle = {{Variational inference for Monte Carlo objectives}},\\nurl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06725},\\nyear = {2016}\\n}',\n",

As we show empirically, the VAE objective can lead to overly simplified representations which fail to use the network's entire modeling capacity. We present the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE), a generative model with the same architecture as the VAE, but which uses a strictly tighter log-likelihood lower bound derived from importance weighting. In the IWAE, the recognition network uses multiple samples to approximate the posterior, giving it increased flexibility to model complex posteriors which do not fit the VAE modeling assumptions.

We combine these ideas into structured receptive field networks, a model which has a fixed filter basis and yet retains the flexibility of CNNs. This flexibil-ity is achieved by expressing receptive fields in CNNs as a weighted sum over a fixed basis which is similar in spirit to Scattering Networks. The key difference is that we learn arbitrary effective filter sets from the basis rather than mod-eling the filters. This approach explicitly connects clas-sical multiscale image analysis with general CNNs.

The majority of current artificial intelligence research operates within a very narrow field of focus, frequently without considering the importance of the 'big picture'. In this document, we seek to describe and unify principles that guide the basis of our development of general artificial intelligence. These principles revolve around the idea that intelligence is a tool for searching for general solutions to problems. We define intelligence as the ability to acquire skills that narrow this search, diversify it and help steer it to more promising areas. We also provide suggestions for studying, measuring, and testing the various skills and abilities that a human-level intelligent machine needs to acquire. The document aims to be both implementation agnostic, and to provide an analytic, systematic, and scalable way to generate hypotheses that we believe are needed to meet the necessary conditions in the search for general artificial intelligence. We believe that such a framework is an important stepping stone for bringing together definitions, highlighting open problems, connecting researchers willing to collaborate, and for unifying the arguably most significant search of this century.},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1611.00685},\\nauthor = {Rosa, Marek and Feyereisl, Jan and {The GoodAI Collective}},\\neprint = {1611.00685},\\njournal = {to be Publ.

If the time series allows us to learn a model with a number of param-eters, then I pred (T) grows logarithmically with a coef that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast, power-law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of in parameter (or non-parametric) models such as continuous functions with smoothness con-straints. There are connections between the predictive information and measures of complexity that have been de both in learning theory and the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Furthermore, in the same way that entropy provides the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of Ipred(T) provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynam-ics underlying a time series.

In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, bene-fiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a \" fast \" reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL 2 , the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (\" slow \") RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including ob-servations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the \" fast \" RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL 2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL 2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL 2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1611.02779},\\nauthor = {Duan, Yan and Schulman, John and Chen, Xi and Bartlett, Peter and Sutskever, Ilya and Abbeel, Pieter},\\noptdoi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201527329},\\neprint = {1611.02779},\\noptisbn = {2004012439},\\noptissn = {0004-6361},\\njournal = {arXiv},\\npages = {1--14},\\npmid = {23459267},\\ntitle = {{RL{\\\\^{}}2: Fast Reinforcement Learning Via Slow Reinforcement Learning}},\\nopturl = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02779v2.pdf},\\nyear = {2016}\\n}',\n",

Video frames or audio samples which are sampled at nearby points in time tend to have similar values. Typically, deep learning algorithms take no advantage of this redundancy to reduce computation. This can be an obscene waste of energy. We present a variant on backpropagation for neural networks in which computation scales with the rate of change of the data - not the rate at which we process the data.

In contrast, our tracker uses a simple feed-forward network with no online training required, allowing our tracker to run at 100 fps during test time. Our tracker trains from both labeled video as well as a large collection of images, which helps prevent overfitting. The tracker learns generic object motion and can be used to track novel objects that do not appear in the training set. We test our network on a standard tracking benchmark to demonstrate our tracker's state-of-the-art performance.

This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU.

In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By optdoing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation.

A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL.

While the negative part is known from the reduction of the hybridization gap due to Zeeman splitting, the positive dependence is similar to what has been observed in other topological insulators (TI). We conclude that the LPMR is a characteristic feature of TI and is related to the linear dispersion near the Dirac cone. The Hall resistance shows a sign change around 50 K. It peaks and becomes nonlinear at around 10 K then decreases below 10 K. This indicates that carriers with opposite signs emerge below 50 K.

One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable variation in the choice of prior and likelihood, since this choice is made by the modeler and is necessarily somewhat subjective. Despite the fundamental importance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, the tools of robust Bayes are not commonly used in practice. This is in large part due to the difficulty of calculating robustness measures from MCMC draws. Although methods for computing robustness measures from MCMC draws exist, they lack generality and often require additional coding or computation. In contrast to MCMC, variational Bayes (VB) techniques are readily amenable to robustness analysis. The derivative of a posterior expectation with respect to a prior or data perturbation is a measure of local robustness to the prior or likelihood. Because VB casts posterior inference as an optimization problem, its methodology is built on the ability to calculate derivatives of posterior quantities with respect to model parameters, even in very complex models. In the present work, we develop local prior robustness measures for mean-field variational Bayes(MFVB), a VB technique which imposes a particular factorization assumption on the variational posterior approximation.

To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory.

In chapters 3 through 6 the author gives a fascinating look at some of the possible features of that transhuman, post-biological world. Those chapters are as interesting and thought-provoking as any that have appeared in more contemporary treatments. Where the book does show it age, however, is in the first three chapters. There the author reviews the history of computer technology, and then succumbs to the shop-worn refrain of many classical AI researchers - \"If only we had a computer that is 100 (or 1000 or 10000) times as powerful as today\\'s machine, then we could program a human-equivalent intelligence\". He even predicts on page 23 that \"a general-purpose robot usable in the home\" will be available within ten years. Well, today we have the computer power he was hoping for and still no general-purpose robot. Bottom line: if you want a fascinating look at what a world with superintelligent machines might be like, then buy this book and start reading at chapter 4.

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, indepen-dent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams\\'s REINFORCE method and actor–critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy. Large applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require the use of generalizing func-tion approximators such neural networks, decision-trees, or instance-based methods. The dominant approach for the last decade has been the value-function approach, in which all function approximation effort goes into estimating a value function, with the action-selection policy represented implicitly as the \" greedy \" policy with respect to the estimated values (e.g., as the policy that selects in each state the action with highest estimated value). The value-function approach has worked well in many appli-cations, but has several limitations. First, it is oriented toward finding deterministic policies, whereas the optimal policy is often stochastic, selecting different actions with specific probabilities (e.g., see Singh, Jaakkola, and Jordan, 1994). Second, an arbi-trarily small change in the estimated value of an action can cause it to be, or not be, selected. Such discontinuous changes have been identified as a key obstacle to estab-lishing convergence assurances for algorithms following the value-function approach (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996). For example, Q-learning, Sarsa, and dynamic pro-gramming methods have all been shown unable to converge to any policy for simple MDPs and simple function approximators (Gordon, 1995, 1996; Baird, 1995; Tsit-siklis and van Roy, 1996; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996).

Importantly, operators enable us to make explicit the statistical and computational tradeoffs for variational inference.

The central question studied in this paper is: given a (possibly cyclic) SCM defined on a large system (consisting of observable endogenous and latent exogenous variables), can we \" project it down \" to an SCM that describes a subsystem (consisting of a subset of the observed endogenous variables and possibly different latent exogenous variables) in order to obtain a more parsimonious but equivalent repre-sentation of the subsystem? We define a marginalization operation that effectively removes a subset of the endogenous variables from the model, and a class of mappings, exogenous reparameterizations, that can be used to reduce the space of exogenous variables. We show that both operations preserve the causal semantics of the model and that under mild conditions they can lead to a significant reduction of the model complexity, at least in terms of the number of variables in the model. We argue that for the task of estimating an SCM from data, the existence of \" smooth \" reduc-tions would be desirable. We provide several conditions under which the existence of such reductions can be shown, but also provide a counterex-ample that shows that such reductions do not exist in general.

Empowerment measures, for agent-environment systems with stochastic transitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that influence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an information-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on environment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by the agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in control theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier work has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant properties, for example, it allows us to identify salient states using only the dynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external reward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of small-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities were assumed to be known. The goal of this article is to extend empowerment to the significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued state spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The continuous state space is addressed by Monte Carlo approximation; the unknown transitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply Gaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting.

To date, the vast majority of successful RNN architectures alleviate this problem by facilitating long-term gradient flow using nearly-additive connections between adjacent states, as originally introduced in long short-term memory (LSTM). In this paper, we investigate a different approach for encouraging gradient flow that is based on NARX RNNs, which generalize typical RNNs by allowing direct connections from the distant past. Analytically, we 1) generalize previous gradient decompositions for typical RNNs to general NARX RNNs and 2) formally connect gradient flow to edges along paths. We then introduce an example architecture that is based on these ideas, and we demonstrate that this architecture matches or exceeds LSTM performance on 5 diverse tasks. Finally we describe many avenues for future work, including the exploration of other NARX RNN architectures, the possible combination of mechanisms from LSTM and NARX RNNs, and the adoption of recent LSTM-based advances to NARX RNN architectures.},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1702.07805},\\nauthor = {DiPietro, Robert and Rupprecht, Christian and Navab, Nassir and Hager, Gregory D.},\\neprint = {1702.07805},\\nmonth = {feb},\\ntitle = {{Analyzing and Exploiting NARX Recurrent Neural Networks for Long-Term Dependencies}},\\nopturl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07805},\\nyear = {2017}\\n}',\n",

Nevertheless, often the overall gist of what the policy does in simulation remains valid in the real world. In this paper we investigate such settings, where the sequence of states traversed in simulation remains reasonable for the real world, even if the details of the controls are not, as could be the case when the key differences lie in detailed friction, contact, mass and geometry properties. During execution, at each time step our approach computes what the simulation-based control policy would do, but then, rather than executing these controls on the real robot, our approach computes what the simulation expects the resulting next state(s) will be, and then relies on a learned deep inverse dynamics model to decide which real-world action is most suitable to achieve those next states.

Because free-energy bounds surprise or the (negative) log-evidence for internal models of the world, this optimization can be regarded as evidence accumulation or (generalized) predictive coding. Crucially, both predictions about the state of the world generating sensory data and the precision of those data have to be optimized. Here, we show that if the precision depends on the states, one can explain many aspects of attention. We illustrate this in the context of the Posner paradigm, using the simulations to generate both psychophysical and electrophysiological responses. These simulated responses are consistent with attentional bias or gating, competition for attentional resources, attentional capture and associated speed-accuracy trade-offs.

In more recent times, however, communication and collaboration between the two fields has become less commonplace. In this article, we argue that better understanding biological brains could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We survey historical interactions between the AI and neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI that have been inspired by the study of neural computation in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting shared themes that may be key for advancing future research in both fields. In recent years, rapid progress has been made in the related fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). At the dawn of the computer age, work on AI was inextricably inter-twined with neuroscience and psychology, and many of the early pioneers straddled both fields, with collaborations between these disciplines proving highly productive (Churchland and Sejnowski, 1988; Hebb, 1949; Hinton et al., 1986; Hopfield, 1982; McCulloch and Pitts, 1943; Turing, 1950). However, more recently, the interaction has become much less common-place, as both subjects have grown enormously in complexity and disciplinary boundaries have solidified. In this review, we argue for the critical and ongoing importance of neuroscience in generating ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research (see Hassabis commentary in Brooks et al., 2012). We begin with the premise that building human-level general AI (or ''Turing-powerful'' intelligent systems; Turing, 1936) is a daunting task, because the search space of possible solutions is vast and likely only very sparsely populated. We argue that this therefore underscores the utility of scrutinizing the inner workings of the human brain— the only existing proof that such an intelligence is even possible. Studying animal cognition and its neural implementation also has a vital role to play, as it can provide a window into various important aspects of higher-level general intelligence. The benefits to developing AI of closely examining biological intelligence are two-fold. First, neuroscience provides a rich source of inspiration for new types of algorithms and architec-tures, independent of and complementary to the mathematical and logic-based methods and ideas that have largely dominated traditional approaches to AI. For example, were a new facet of biological computation found to be critical to supporting a cogni-tive function, then we would consider it an excellent candidate for incorporation into artificial systems. Second, neuroscience can provide validation of AI techniques that already exist. If a known algorithm is subsequently found to be implemented in the brain, then that is strong support for its plausibility as an in-tegral component of an overall general intelligence system.

However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are \"scaled exponential linear units\" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set.

(iii) The converged layers lie on or very close to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theoretical bound, and the maps from the input to any hidden layer and from this hidden layer to the output satisfy the IB self-consistent equations. This generalization through noise mechanism is unique to Deep Neural Networks and absent in one layer networks. (iv) The training time is dramatically reduced when adding more hidden layers.

Despite potential pitfalls of such benchmarks, they have proved to be extremely helpful to advance the state of the art in the respective area. Interestingly, there has been rather limited work on the standardization of quantitative benchmarks for multiple target tracking. One of the few exceptions is the well-known PETS dataset, targeted primarily at surveillance applications. Despite being widely used, it is often applied inconsistently, for example involving using different subsets of the available data, different ways of training the models, or differing evaluation scripts. This paper describes our work toward a novel multiple object tracking benchmark aimed to address such issues. We discuss the challenges of creating such a framework, collecting existing and new data, gathering state-of-the-art methods to be tested on the datasets, and finally creating a unified evaluation system. With MOTChallenge we aim to pave the way toward a unified evaluation framework for a more meaningful quantification of multi-target tracking.},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1504.01942},\\nauthor = {Leal-Taix{\\\\'{e}}, Laura and Milan, Anton and Reid, Ian and Roth, Stefan and Schindler, Konrad},\\neprint = {1504.01942},\\nmonth = {apr},\\ntitle = {{MOTChallenge 2015: Towards a Benchmark for Multi-Target Tracking}},\\nopturl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01942},\\nyear = {2015}\\n}\",\n",

Despite this, few researchers dare to train their models from scratch. Most work builds on one of a handful of ImageNet pre-trained models, and fine-tunes or adapts these for specific tasks. This is in large part due to the difficulty of properly initializing these networks from scratch. A small miscalibration of the initial weights leads to vanishing or exploding gradients, as well as poor convergence properties. In this work we present a fast and simple data-dependent initialization procedure, that sets the weights of a network such that all units in the network train at roughly the same rate, avoiding vanishing or exploding gradients. Our initialization matches the current state-of-the-art unsupervised or self-supervised pre-training methods on standard computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, while being roughly three orders of magnitude faster. When combined with pre-training methods, our initialization significantly outperforms prior work, narrowing the gap between supervised and unsupervised pre-training.},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1511.06856},\\nauthor = {Kr{\\\\\"{a}}henb{\\\\\"{u}}hl, Philipp and Doersch, Carl and Donahue, Jeff and Darrell, Trevor},\\neprint = {1511.06856},\\njournal = {Int.

Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data – as commonly encountered in robotics applications – and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise},\\narchivePrefix = {arXiv},\\narxivId = {1602.00991},\\nauthor = {Ondruska, Peter and Posner, Ingmar},\\nbooktitle = {AAAI},\\neprint = {1602.00991},\\noptisbn = {9781577357605},\\nkeywords = {Technical Papers: Robotics},\\nmonth = {feb},\\npages = {3361--3367},\\npmid = {217420},\\ntitle = {{Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks}},\\nopturl = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00991 http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/{~}mobile/Papers/2016AAAI{\\\\_}ondruska.pdf{\\\\%}5Cnhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdeWCpfUGWc},\\nyear = {2016}\\n}\\n\\n% !tex root=main.tex',\n",
